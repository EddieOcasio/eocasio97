- 👋 Hi, I’m @eocasio97
- 👀 I’m interested in learning best development practices, currently for SQL (SSMS), C#, and Linq languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to innovate changes to daily tasks I find monotous or extensive.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development. At the moment, I'm currently learning, so I'm only decent with SQL with very minimal C# knowledge. I'm hoping to update this soon saying I'm decent with all 3!
